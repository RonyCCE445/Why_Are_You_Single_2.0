    <em>"You talk. We analyze. Then gently roast you with science."</em><br>
    Here’s an overview of the techy magic behind your existential crisis.

    <h2> The Two Paths</h2>
    <p>
      You get two equally judgmental options: 
      <strong>Write an Intro</strong> or <strong>Take the Quiz</strong>.
      <br><br>
      - <strong>The Intro</strong> reflects how <em>you see yourself</em>. <br>
      -  <strong>The Quiz</strong> reveals how <em>the app sees you</em> — based on your choices, logic, and emotional damage.
    </p>

    <h2> Intro Path: NLP & Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      When you write your intro, it gets analyzed using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline powered by a trained Machine Learning model. <br><br>
      Here's what happens:
      <ul>
        <li>→ Your text is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized using a TF-IDF approach.</li>
        <li>→ A classification model (like Naive Bayes or similar) predicts your MBTI type based on patterns learned from hundreds of labeled samples.</li>
        <li>→ Basically, we judge your soul by your sentence structure. Cute, right?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="result-section">
    <h2> Quiz Path: Trait-Based Inference</h2>
    <p>
      The quiz isn’t just random nonsense — every question is designed to reflect one of the MBTI dichotomies: 
      <strong>E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P</strong>. <br><br>
      Here's how we decode you:
      <ul>
        <li>→ Each answer you choose is tagged with a corresponding trait.</li>
        <li>→ We tally your responses and infer the dominant letters based on your behavioral leanings.</li>
        <li>→ Your final MBTI is a reflection of how you behave when you're being guided — a.k.a., when the app steers the ship.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="result-section">
    <h2> Interpretation Layer</h2>
    <p>
      After we detect your MBTI, the app cross-references it with a few lovingly handpicked datasets:
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Personality traits unique to your type</li>
        <li>✔ Rarity of your type in the general population (or internet dwellers)</li>
        <li>✔ Famous personalities that share your code (allegedly)</li>
      </ul>
      You also get a sarcastic roast — because honesty hurts but jokes heal.
