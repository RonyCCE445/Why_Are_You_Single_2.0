    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Who?</h2>
    <p>
      Just a silly dev with an obsession for neon lights, dark humor, and psychoanalyzing strangers.<br><br>

      I'm <strong>Koustav Chakraborty</strong>, a B.Tech undergrad from India. One evening, I was listening to a friend’s breakup story when I realized… my ceiling is amazingly interesting.<br><br>

      So, to help friends (and save listeners), I made this.<br><br>

      Just kidding. You’re amazing. Whatever I’ve learned from your personality type, you’re a solid human being.<br><br>
